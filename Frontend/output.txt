I have updated the Blog page with a professional two-column layout, as requested.

The page now features:
- A main content area with detailed blog post summaries (including images, metadata, and excerpts).
- A sidebar with sections for Search, Categories, and Recent Posts.

This aligns with the structure of the reference blog page you provided. Please let me know if you have any other questions or tasks.
